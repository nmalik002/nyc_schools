# nyc_schools
The goal of the this project is to find insights on which factors were related to student SAT scores in New York City. To find these insights I used the pandas/numpy libraries to filter and find correlations in reference to race, area of schools, AP scores, survey responses, etc.

This repo contains the datasets used and the jupyter notebooks I used for scripting.
